# ðŸ”Œ Binean Nova VsCode Extension

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Introduction

The **Binean Nova Extension** is a powerful toolset integrated into **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, designed to revolutionize the development and operations (DevOps) workflow for the Ingenium system.

Working with a legacy system like Ingenium often involves manual, complex, and error-prone processes. The **Binean Nova Extension** was created as a comprehensive solution to break down these barriers, delivering a modern, seamless, and efficient development experience directly within the familiar VS Code environment.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

To use the **Binean Nova Extension**, your environment must meet the following requirements:

- **Required Software:**
  - Visual Cobol
  - Db2 Server (or Db2 Client)
- **Required VS Code Extensions:**
  - `Rocket COBOL` (by OpenText)
  - `Cobol` (by BitLang)
  - `Git`

## âœ¨ Key Components

The **Binean Nova Extension** is composed of several specialized tools, each designed to solve a specific problem in the Ingenium workflow. This toolset will be continuously expanded in the future to meet new project requirements.

### 1. Nexus Core
- **Common Platform:** Provides core features such as managing environment configurations (Dev, ST, AT), automating environment variable setup, and serving as the foundation for other components.
- **VS Code Integration:** Ensures that the underlying tools can interact seamlessly with the VS Code interface, such as displaying errors in the "Problems" tab.

### 2. `icomp` & `igo` Compilation Toolset
- **`icomp` (For Developers):** An intelligent compilation tool with deep Git integration. It analyzes changes between branches to perform incremental compilation on impacted programs, saving time and ensuring accuracy directly in the development environment.
- **`igo` (For DevOps - To Be Developed):** An extension of `icomp`, designed to fully automate the compilation and packaging process on server environments. `igo` will be the key component for seamless integration into future CI/CD pipelines.

### 3. `iman` Manager
- **Efficient Worker Management:** Ingenium's queue workers are single-threaded COBOL programs, typically launched as multiple processes to handle tasks in parallel. `iman` (Ingenium Manager) was created to effectively monitor and manage these processes on both Windows and Linux.
- **Rapid Debugging:** On Windows, `iman` offers a debug mode that can automatically attach to a worker process and trigger a debugging session in VS Code, dramatically simplifying the process of finding and fixing complex bugs.
- **Security:** Includes a feature to encrypt database connection passwords, enhancing system security.
- **Future Direction:** Advanced features like autoscaling based on workload will be researched and developed in subsequent project phases.

### 4. `ibatch` Batch Runner
- **Cross-Platform Batch Job Execution:** `ibatch` is a dedicated tool for executing Ingenium batch jobs.
- **Windows & Linux Support:** Ensures that batch jobs can run consistently across both development (Windows) and server (Linux) environments.

## ðŸš€ Initial Features

The current version of the extension provides foundational features for initializing and configuring the workspace (to be expanded in the future):

### 1. `Initialize Ingenium Cobol Workspace`
- **Purpose:** Quickly initialize a standard workspace for an Ingenium project.
- **Action:** This command automatically creates the necessary configuration files in the `.vscode` folder.
- **User Configuration:** After initialization, the user must provide essential information such as the Visual Cobol installation path, Db2 login credentials, etc. (detailed instructions will be available in the extension's documentation).

### 2. `Update Configuration`
- **Purpose:** Synchronize configurations and create a dedicated command-line environment.
- **Action:** Based on the user-provided information, this command generates a `Noval.cmd` file.
- **Dedicated Environment:** The `Noval.cmd` file is used to open a command prompt window with all the necessary environment variables pre-configured. All tools in the Nova project (`icomp`, `igo`, `iman`) must be run within this environment. A shortcut to this file will be placed on the Desktop for easy access.

## ðŸ’¡ Benefits

- **Increased Productivity:** Minimizes manual, repetitive tasks, allowing developers to focus on developing business logic.
- **Reduced Errors:** Automation and intelligent compilation ensure consistency and accuracy, minimizing human-induced risks.
- **Standardized Workflow:** Establishes a modern, accessible workflow for new developers and simplifies management for the entire team.
- **Modernized Experience:** Brings the world of modern DevOps to a traditional system, creating an effective and professional working environment.
